# FinanceDash

Dashboard written on python using Dash framework to analyze data from brazilian financial market. It's not finished yet, there are several things that 
I'd like to implement and improve yet, and it's not published yet, so if you want to see it you must run index.py

The data used on this project is actually part of another project (this is still private on Git, I will fix it before making it public). On this project 
I extract the data from CVM, B3 and other tools like yahooFinance, etc, and then I clean and process the data to use on this dashboard. All the datasets used are on the folder
'DADOS' (they are not always up to date).

Here you can see some images from the dashboard:
